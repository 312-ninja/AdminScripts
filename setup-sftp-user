April 12th, 2011 · No Comments · Centos, HowTo, Installation, Tips and Tricks

Setup sftp-only access on default Redhat/CentOS install. Use built-in sftp-server which is non-chrooted and easy to setup.

Server: Locate sftp-server binary and add to your list of valid shells on the system.

which sftp-server

Note:   This will most likely give you this: /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server

echo /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server >> /etc/shells

Note:  You may want to backup your /etc/shells first

User Accounts:  Add or modify accounts to use sftp-server.

New User

useradd -s /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server  sftponlyuser

Note:  Important parameter there is the “-s /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server”, which sets the default shell for this account.   By default you will have “/bin/bash”.

Existing User:

vi /etc/passwd

Find the user that you want to configure for sftp only access and edit its shell.  For exampleyou will see a line “username:x:500:500::/home/username:/bin/bash” change “/bin/bash” to “/usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server” and save.  Note: You may want to backup your /etc/passwd file as well.
